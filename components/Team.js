              </h5>
              Originally from New Orleans, relocated to Atlanta during Hurricane
              Katrina, but I am born and raised a NOLA kid. I attended Xavier
              university of Louisiana and graduated from Operation Spark, a local
              software development bootcamp.Â I worked on projects for GE, Revelry
              Labs, Krit, Tulane University, and Virginia Tech. My main interests revolve around
              family, tech, and sports. Other than being with friends in family I
              enjoy most things tech. Video games are a big pass time for me, i
              enjoy RPG's games where i can be my own character and just explore
              the world.

              CTO, Akintunde Pounds
            </h5>
            Originally from the Midwest, I moved to New Orleans when I was a
            child. As a kid, although I wanted to make videos games, I believed
            I could not learn the programmming knowledge neccessary to be a
            video game developer. That all changed when I was engrossed myself
            in a network of software engineers. Like my partner Eric, I also
            graduated from Operation Spark. I was an instructor at Operation for
            two years and also worked on various projects for Revelry Labs. I
            also enjoy exploring blockchain technology, especially open source.
            Some of my favorite hobbies include spending time with my family and
            making electronic music.
