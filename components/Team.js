                    Originally from New Orleans, relocated to Atlanta during Hurricane Katrina, but I am born and raised a NOLA kid. I attended Xavier university of Louisiana and graduated from Operation Spark, a local software development bootcamp.Â I worked on projects for GE, Revelry Labs, Krit, and Tulane University.
                    My main interests revolve around family, tech, and sports. Other than being with friends in family I enjoy most things tech. Video games are a big pass time for me, i enjoy RPG's games where i can be my own character and just explore the world.

                Originally from the Midwest, I moved to New Orleans when I was a child. As a kid, although I wanted to make videos games, I believed I could not learn the programmming knowledge neccessary to be a video game developer. That all changed when I was engrossed myself in a network of software engineers. Like my partner Eric, I also graduated from Operation Spark. I was an instructor at Operation for two years and also worked on various projects for Revelry Labs. I also enjoy exploring blockchain technology, especially open source. Some of my favorite hobbies include spending time with my family and making electronic music.
